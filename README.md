Voting system in campus

This is a program which resembles a prototype of voting system.
It scans number of parties, and its respective party names.

While voting, the program requests for unique voter ID number, scans the voter's vote and adds a count to that respective party.
At last it asks for menu, and according to the user's choice it may again proceed for more voting or vote analysis or exit from the program.

Advantages:
1. Program is short.
2. Program scans each voter's vote one at a time.
3. Gives accurate result with no. of votes and with percentage of vote acquired by a party upto 6 decimal places.
4. Gives result in a separate output file which can be referred afterwards. 

Disadvantages:
1. Voter's vote is visible.
2. Voters who are in a campus, who are literate can only vote as this program does not display the symbol of the party.
